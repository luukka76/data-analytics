Matlab files for data analytics methods

Here you can find matlab files from some of my papers

Feature selection:

 Similarity Classifier, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, pp.
 4600-4607

And also Fuzzy similarity based fuzzy TOPSIS method originally published in:

[2.] P. Luukka, Fuzzy Similarity in Multicriteria Decision-Making Problem Applied to Supplier Evaluation and Selection in
Supply Chain Management, Advances in Artificial Intelligence, 2011, 9 pages.
doi:10.1155/2011/353509

Later enhanced to cover four different similarities and applied with overall ranking to evaluate R&D projects as investements in:

measure based TOPSIS variants, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 26,6, (2014), pp. 1-11. 
doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2260758

Similarity based classifier with ordered weighted averaging operators:

Expert Systems With Applications, 40, (2013), pp. 995-1002

Consistency and coverage computations and degree of proof and disproof:
