Matlab files for data analytics methods

Here you can find matlab files from paper
1 P. Luukka, (2011) Feature Selection Using Fuzzy Entropy Measures with
 Similarity Classifier, Expert Systems with Applications, 38, pp.
 4600-4607

And also Fuzzy similarity based fuzzy TOPSIS method originally published in:

Supply Chain Management, Advances in Artificial Intelligence, 2011, 9 pages.
doi:10.1155/2011/353509

Later enhanced to cover four different similarities and applied with overall ranking to evaluate R&D projects as investements in:
